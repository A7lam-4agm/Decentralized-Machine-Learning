# 🧠 Decentralized Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains my course projects for **CS 595: Decentralized Machine Learning** at **Illinois Institute of Technology**.

It includes two projects demonstrating advanced applications of distributed AI, neural networks, and cloud-based learning systems.

## 📘 Project 1 – CIFAR-10 Neural Network Comparison

**Goal:** Compare two neural network architectures — a **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** and a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** — for image classification using the **CIFAR-10 dataset**.

**Highlights:**
- Implemented both models in **PyTorch**
- Achieved **78.07%** accuracy with CNN vs. **51.62%** with MLP
- Explored learning rates and regularization effects
- Report written and visualized using Apple Silicon GPU acceleration

## ☁️ Project 2 – Federated Learning on Chameleon Cloud

**Goal:** Simulate a **Federated Learning (FL)** environment to train a shared model across multiple distributed clients without centralizing data.

**Highlights:**
- Built using **Python, PyTorch, and FastAPI**
- Implemented **ResNet-18** model across 64 simulated clients
- Deployed on **Chameleon Cloud** using Docker containers
- Demonstrated data privacy and collaborative model improvement
